## Setup Instructions



Let's get started.

## Service Manual

Setup is just the beginning. Now we need to keep a close eye on things to keep
your system healthy and happy. Happy fish, plants and bacteria all require a
careful balance of ph, ammonia, nitrites and nitrates. There are many other
aspects but we'll get to that in due course.

### Acidity

pH levels range from 0 - 14 with 7 being the balance point in the middle.
The lower the number, the higher the acidity. Above 7 is alkaline.
For the most part we want 7 or below.
